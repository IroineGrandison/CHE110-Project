            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p class="description">The combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global climate change. 
                    <i> In the late 19th century, the development of the electrical grid revolutionized the way we distribute and consume electricity.<br>
                        During this period, coal-fired power plants became the primary source of electricity, driving the industrial revolution and shaping modern society. 
                        However, these plants came with the unintended consequence of air pollution, leading to growing concerns about environmental sustainability.</i> <br>
                        In an age defined by the pursuit of innovation and progress, sustainable electricity usage is not just a choice; it's a necessity. 
                        It represents our commitment to a world where we can power our lives without jeopardizing the health of our planet.<br> 
                        As we delve into the pages that follow, we invite you to join us in this critical exploration of <br><br>
                        "Powering Our World: The Challenge of Sustainable Electricity Usage."<br>
                        Solar and wind power, in particular, have witnessed remarkable advancements, with the cost of production steadily decreasing. 
                        These sources offer the advantage of being abundant and widely distributed, with the potential to meet a significant portion of our energy needs. <br>
                        Additionally, hydroelectric power has long been a staple of sustainable electricity generation, harnessing the energy of flowing water to produce electricity.
            </p>

            <h2>Materials & Methods</h2>
            <p>In this section, we outline the materials and methodologies employed in our research to investigate the complex issue of sustainable electricity usage. 
                A robust and transparent methodology is essential for the credibility and reproducibility of our findings.<br><br><br>
                
                Government Reports and Databases: <br>
                We accessed government databases and reports from agencies such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
                These sources provided invaluable statistics on electricity generation, consumption, and environmental impacts.<br><br>

                Electricity generation trends: <br> 
                Our analysis of historical data revealed significant shifts in electricity generation trends.<br>
                Conventional energy sources, such as coal and oil, have seen a gradual decline, while renewable energy sources, including solar and wind, have experienced exponential growth.<br>
                This transition is indicative of a global shift towards cleaner, more sustainable electricity generation.<br><br>

                Environmental Impacts: <br>
                We assessed the environmental impacts of electricity generation, considering greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and resource depletion.<br>
                The findings underscore the stark contrast between conventional and sustainable energy sources. <br>
                Conventional sources continue to contribute significantly to global carbon emissions, whereas sustainable sources exhibit minimal emissions and reduced environmental harm.<br><br>

                Energy Efficiency and Conservation: <br>
                Our study also explored the significance of energy efficiency and conservation measures in reducing electricity consumption. <br>
                The data revealed that improved energy efficiency practices and conservation efforts have the potential to significantly reduce electricity demand and lower environmental impact.<br><br>
